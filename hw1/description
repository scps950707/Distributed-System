test1.txt and test2.txt are the example files, and then it has more than two nodes that have the same W(v) / (deg(v) + 1) value in test2.txt. 
Please refer to test_result1.txt and test_result2.txt to check what result you should output.
Also, please compress your folder , and hand it in.

Your folder should be named after[student_ID], and must include the following three files:
1.exercise_a
   It is your source code of exercise(a), and it must be coded in Python, Java, C or C++.
2.exercise_b
   It is your source code of exercise(b), and it must be coded in Python, Java, C or C++.
3.README.md
   Please tell me how to input the test file name so that I can change file name when I check your codes.

Have a good programming time!
